# BuyMeACoffee
Road To Web3 by Alchemy - Week 2 project completion

## The project

Create a Buy Me A Coffee website that lets users connect their wallet and then allow you to buy 1 coffee (0.001 ETH) or 3 coffees (0.003 ETH). Include a form with their name and a message they can leave behind. The messages can be pulled from the contract and are listed on the site. 

- Used Hardhad and Ethers.js to create, test, and deploy smart contract "contracts/BuyMeACoffee.sol"
- Used Alchemy and MetaMask to deploy the smart contract to the Goerli testnet
- In Replit, used Next.js and React to create the front end. 
- Ethers.js to load the contract ABI and interact with the smart contract.
- You can get free Goerli ETH at: goerlifaucet.com

dotenv is used to store passwords locally in this format, ".env" file containing:
GOERLI_URL=...
